  About the "inspiration", Valerio Proietti wrote an email that
  can be found at BTS #500697:
    .
    "We actually never "borrow" a single line of code from anywhere. What
    we "borrow" is the technique to make some pretty obscure thing work
    cross-browser-ly. For Instance, the element dimensions. From the code
    of qoodooxo I just understood what's the technique to find the offset
    parent of an element, and I implemented my own code to do that. I
    always put the notice in the header of the file for respect of the
    technique discovery. But there isn't a single line of code that is
    actually copied and pasted from other projects. Also, as said, every
    time I do that its reported in the file header, along with the project
    homepage and license, so those comments you find in the headers are
    really all there is that didn't come out directly out of our brains."
